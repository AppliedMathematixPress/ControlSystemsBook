**Applied Mathematix Press** proudly presents the book "Control Systems" by Pantelis Sopasakis.

This book's objective is to equip the students of engineering schools with the necessary theoretical tools and practical skills (including programming) to analyse dynamical systems and design appropriate controllers. 

The book starts with an introductory chapter on modelling of physical systems, gives a brief presentation of linearisation, and moves on to the frequency domain with the introduction of the Laplace transform and its inverse. This brings us to the concept of a transfer function, which is a notion of central importance in classical control theory. We give the definition of BIBO stability and state the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We then move to the frequency domain: we discuss the properties of the steady state frequency response of the system and state the Bode stability criterion and conclude with the powerful Nyquist criterion.

The theory is presented in a rigorous, yet accessible way, while numerous examples with illustrations help the reader to solidify their understanding and avoid common pitfalls and caveats. 


##### Numerous worked-out examples
Each piece of theory is followed by plenty of worked-out examples with figures and detailed derivations and discussion of the results<br/>

##### Hundreds of exercises with hints and answers

The book counts over 280 exercises, the majority of which are accompanied by short answers and/or hints. In fact, the answers are written at the end of the exercise, but upside down.<br/>
