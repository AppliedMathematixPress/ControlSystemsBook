**Applied Mathematix Press** proudly presents the book "Control Systems" by Pantelis Sopasakis.

This book's objective is to equip the students of engineering schools with the necessary theoretical tools and practical skills (including programming) to analyse dynamical systems and design appropriate controllers. 

The focus is on ... 

The theory is presented in a rigorous, yet accessible way, while numerous examples with illustrations help the reader to solidify their understanding and avoid common pitfalls and caveats. 

Here are some key features of *Control Theory*

##### Numerous worked-out examples
Each piece of theory is followed by plenty of worked-out examples with figures and detailed derivations and discussion of the results<br/>
